1) Get regression of form stock = m * sentiment + b
2) take twitter sentiments for a new day i, sentiment_i
3) stock_i = m * sentiment_i + b (fit it into the regression)
4) (optional) smooth the curve - stock_i = alpha * stock_{i-1} + (1 -
alpha) * m * sentiment_i + b
       	alpha is between 0 to 1, a smoothing factor
5) repeat for all predictions
